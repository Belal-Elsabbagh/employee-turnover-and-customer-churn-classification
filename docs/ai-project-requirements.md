# AI Project

## Requirements

- Python code
  - Apply 5 or more classifiers on 2-3 Datasets
  - Compare results
- LaTeX research paper (Overleaf)

## Research Paper Sections

The LaTeX template will be sent by the Dr but in general, these are the necessary sections.

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Related work
- Proposed methodology
  - Dataset description and samples
  - Model description
- Results
  - Score comparison
  - Discussion
- Conclusion

## Algorithms

- KNN
- Decision Tree
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic regression
- Random forest

## Process

1. Train the models
  - read csv file.
  - split
  - build model
  - test
2. Compare results
3. Write paper

## Measuring Results Performance

- Confusion matrix
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Specificity
- F1 score
- Precision-Recall or PR curve
- ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve
- PR vs ROC curve.
